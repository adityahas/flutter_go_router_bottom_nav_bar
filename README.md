It is based on this article on my website:

- [Flutter Bottom Navigation Bar with Stateful Nested Routes using GoRouter](https://codewithandrea.com/articles/flutter-bottom-navigation-bar-nested-routes-gorouter-beamer)

To see how the example app is implemented using the two packages, check these folders:

- [Beamer example](examples/beamer)
